# Debian Install Scripts

Scripts for installing specific toolchains on Debian-based
systems (`apt` is used when possible). Bash is the expected
shell, but some scripts might work with other shells.

In order to run the scripts, you might first need to give execution
permission to the file.

```bash
chmod +x <file path>
```

To run a script use `.` or `source`.

```bash
./<file path>
source <file path>
```
